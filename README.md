ðŸ“Š Case Study: Reducing Forest Ranger Attrition in India
Overview
Indiaâ€™s National Parksâ€”like Nagarahole, Kaziranga, Bandipur, Gir, and Jim Corbettâ€”depend on Forest Protection Officers (FPOs) to guard wildlife, prevent poaching, and ensure safety.

However, rising FPO attrition rates are causing serious operational and financial challenges.

This case study analyzes:

The cost of losing FPOs (â‚¹26.5 Lakhs per officer)

The key reasons behind attrition (family issues, limited career growth, low pay)

Actionable solutions across three pillars:

Family-Friendliness

Career Growth Opportunities

Performance-Based Rewards

Problem Statement
Despite a modest attrition rate of 4.67%, the cost of losing FPOs is disproportionately high due to their critical role.

If not addressed, this issue will lead to:

Operational risks (poaching, forest fires, safety lapses)

Financial losses (â‚¹25.97 Crores in 2023)

Reduced morale among remaining staff

Proposed Solutions
Pillar	Action
Family-Friendly Policies	Hire locally, offer online schooling support, flexible postings
Career Development	Leadership tracks, mentorship, cross-department exposure
Fair Compensation	Salary parity with police/paramilitary, overtime pay, recognition programs

Impact & Feasibility
Solution	Cost	Impact
Hire Locally	Low	Retains officers near home
Online Schooling Support	Medium	Reduces family stress
Leadership Development	Low	Boosts morale & retention
Salary & Overtime Alignment	High	Competitive retention strategy

Next Steps
Pilot Program â€“ Start with Nagarahole, Kaziranga, and Bandipur

Feedback Loop â€“ Collect insights from FPOs and leadership

Scale Nationally â€“ Roll out successful policies across Indiaâ€™s parks

Final Thoughts
Retaining skilled FPOs is crucial for Indiaâ€™s conservation efforts. With the right mix of family support, career growth, and fair pay, the Indian Forest Department can create a sustainable system for both officers and wildlife protection.
